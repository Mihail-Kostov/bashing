way.

mkdir -p ~/.bin && curl -fkLo ~/.bin/bashing https://raw.github.com/xsc/bashing/stable/bin/bashing.stable && chmod +x ~/.bin/bashing
```

## Bashing Bashing

To build bashing, check out this repository and run:

```
$ ./bin/bashing.dev uberbash
Creating /git/public/bashing/target/bashing-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.sh ...

This will create a standalone bashing script using ... wait for it ... bashing itself!
